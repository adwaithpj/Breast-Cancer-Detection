  <h1>Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning techniques. We have utilized the logistic regression algorithm as our model to train the data.</p>
  <h2>Data Source</h2>
  <p>The dataset used for training and testing the model has been sourced from Kaggle, a well-known website that provides real-world datasets for various domains. Specifically, the dataset used in this project is breastcancer.csv.</p>
  <h2>Model Description</h2>
  <p>The model employed in this project is a classification model that predicts whether a person has a malignant or benign state of breast cancer. Logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm, has been implemented to achieve this goal. Logistic regression analyzes the relationship between input features and the probability of a specific outcome, in this case, the classification of breast cancer.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use this project, follow the steps below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed (list the dependencies if applicable).</li>
    <li>Execute the <code>breastcancer.ipynb</code> notebook or the corresponding script to train the logistic regression model on the breast cancer dataset.</li>
    <li>Once the model is trained, use the <code>breastcancer.csv</code> file to input new data and classify whether a person has a malignant or benign state of breast cancer.</li>
  </ol>
